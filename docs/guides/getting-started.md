# DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog (DEVREL-TC)

## INTRODUCTION

A *Tool* is used by a DevRel practitioner to carry out their function and complete tasks. The **Tools Catalog** is a collection of the resources that can be acquired by an organization for use in these day-to-day work activities.

Typically, this includes assets such as:

* digital
* physical

Tutorials related to the use of a specific tool are relevant, but other knowledge resources in general such as books, frameworks, processes, communities, content distribution channels, etc. are out of scope.

The **DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog** (DEVREL-TC) is an opinionated-framework for defining tools that are included and to aid devrel teams in the evaluation and selection of tools.

### Problem

It is not challenging to identify a list of available tools. Selection of the tools is the core problem because it becomes a matching problem.

* difficult to categorize tools in an intuitive way for all audiences
* difficult to evaluate tools (licensing, costs, interoperability, etc.) that may be dependent on organization environment
* difficult to source practical recommendations
* difficult to address bias as many tools are commercial or for promotional purposes

### Benefits

The DevRel Tools Catalog supports practitioners by sourcing and indexing relevant tools that can be presented in various views.

This is valuable because it aids in:
- prioritization
- acquisition
- application of tool to a task

Further, the tool catalog is helpful for:
- identifying for new employees during onboarding all the tools they should use to accomplish a niche devrel task
- help us re-tool and grow in our process and workflows

## CORE CONCEPTS

Some of the core concepts for the Tools Catalog:

- Structured Syntax
- Jobs to be Done
- Evaluating Programs
- Indexing Tools

### Structured Syntax

To get value from a tool we must:

- find tools that solve the problem we have (but may not know the taxonomy)
- be able to figure out the problems a tool solves
- be able to add criteria to discovery and evaluation

The DEVREL-TC is a schema and data structure instead of a simple list. In some cases we want a list for easy scanning, but in others for evaluation we may want a more data rich description to help with selection or how to learn. The tools to support the syntax allows us to accomplish this.

- JSON schema
- validation tools
- transformation tools
- many-to-many relationship for categorization

### Jobs to be Done

Taking inspiration from Jobs to be Done:

- labels - simple categorization
- job categories - based on roles
- situation --> when I ...
- motivation --> I want to ...
- outcomes --> so I can ...

**Tool Stacks** acknowledge that for many jobs, a single tool is insufficient to achieve an outcome.

Some examples of job categories include: Technical Writing, Public Speaking, Graphic Design, User Experience, Developer Marketing, Web Development, Video Production, and so on.

Some examples of outcomes include: create infographic, create a logo, create a tutorial, create API reference, create a video tutorial, etc.

### Evaluating Programs

Tools are often selected by recommendations from others who have successfully used it in practice. DevRel will often look to DevRel as a proof point on whether adopting a tool will be successful within an environment.

Some of the evaluation criteria includes:

- program: the devrel team that has provided insight into their evaluation and decision
- pricing: free open-source, saas, etc.
- compatibility: framework, web-based apps, mobile apps, etc.
- customizability: components, configuration, open-source
- notes: free-form recommendations

### Indexing Tools

The indexes allow us to present the tools in multiple views with consistent validated data.

- by label
- by job to be done
- by tool stack
- by devrel program

Automation of these tools would be centrally managed to make it easier to contribute and consume tool insights.
