# Tools Catalog

The **Tools Catalog** is a [DevRel Foundation](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation) (DRF) initiative to collect software and tools that aid in completion of developer relations activities. This catalog helps support discovery of resources that help solve day-to-day operatonal challenges.

## DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog (DEVREL-TC)

The DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog is an opinionated configuration framework for defining tools in a structured language (JSON) that adheres to an agreed upon standard schema. 

By defining tools in this way, we can establish tooling to validate, restructure, transform views on how to evalate tools for use.
